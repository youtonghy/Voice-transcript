Coding and Localization Guidelines

- Code identifiers, comments, and internal logs must be written in English.
- Only user-facing UI text (strings rendered to the screen) may use Chinese.
- Avoid non-ASCII characters in source code except within UI strings.
- When adding diagnostics, prefer English labels; if shown in the UI, Chinese is acceptable for user clarity.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing style.
